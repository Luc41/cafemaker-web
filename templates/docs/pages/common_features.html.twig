    <h1>Common Features</h1>

    <h4>Global Params</h4>
    <p>These params work on almost every API route.</p>

    {{ docs.param('language', '/item/1675?language=fr', 'language') }}
    <p>This will tell the API to handle the request and the response in the specified language. For Chinese, please use <a href="https://github.com/thewakingsands/cafemaker/wiki">Waking Sands</a></p>
    <table class="param-table">
        <tr>
            <td width="5%">en</td>
            <td>English</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ja</td>
            <td>Japanese</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>de</td>
            <td>German</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>fr</td>
            <td>French</td>
        </tr>
       {# <tr>
            <td>cn</td>
            <td>Chinese (Soon)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>kr</td>
            <td>Korean (Soon)</td>
        </tr> #}
    </table>

    <p>
        To help with development; you may want to use the simplified field <code>Name</code>.
        If you can provide the query <code>language=fr</code> and now <code>Name</code> will be the French name.
        This is also extended to other string fields such as Descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Search will use the language parameter to decide which field to query the <code>string</code>
        against, for example: <code>language=fr&string=LeAwsome</code> will search for <code>LeAwesome</code> on the
        field <code>Name_fr</code>.
    </p>

    {{ docs.gap() }}
    {{ docs.param('pretty', '/item/1675?pretty=1', 'pretty') }}
    <p>
        This will provide a nice pretty JSON response, this is intended for debugging
        purposes. Don't use this in production as it adds weight to the response and queries will be longer.
    </p>

    {{ docs.gap() }}
    {{ docs.param('snake_case', '/item/1675?snake_case=1', 'snake_case') }}
    <p>
        All API responses by default are UpperCase as this is the format the game
        data is extracted, to maintain consistency all endpoints will return data
        in UpperCase format, however if you prefer snake case this will convert all
        UpperCaseFields into lower_snake_case_fields.
    </p>

    {{ docs.gap() }}
    {{ docs.param('columns', '/item/1675?columns=ID,Name,Icon,ClassJobCategory.Name', 'columns') }}
    <p>
        This query allows specific columns to be pulled from the data and exclude the rest of
        the JSON response. This allows you narrow down to specific bits of information and reduce
        the size of the payload to your application. For nested data you can use dot notation
        (to a max of 10 nested nodes) to access it, for example:
    </p>
    <pre class="box">[
    {
        "ID": 2901,
        "Icon": "\/i\/040000\/040635.png",
        "Name": "Choral Chapeau",
        "ClassJobCategory": {
            "Name": "BRD"
        }
    },
    {
        "ID": 2902,
        "Icon": "\/i\/041000\/041041.png",
        "Name": "Healer's Circlet",
        "ClassJobCategory": {
            "Name": "WHM"
        }
    },
    {
        "ID": 2903,
        "Icon": "\/i\/040000\/040634.png",
        "Name": "Wizard's Petasos",
        "ClassJobCategory": {
            "Name": "BLM"
        }
    }
]
</pre>

    <p>
        For list content, `columns` will be done on all entries within the list.
        On non-list content the whole document is treated.
    </p>

    <p>Sometimes a piece of data will have an array of sub data, for example:</p>
<pre class="box">{
    "ID": 1,
    "Name": "Example",
    "Items": [
        {
            "Name": "foo"
        },
        {
            "Name": "bar"
        }
    ]
}</pre>

    <p>To access the data in `Items` individually you could do</p>
    <code class="box">columns=Items.0.Name,Items.1.Name</code>

    <p>
        However, if you imagine an array having 50 items this could become tedious. You can therefore use a
        count format, eg:
    </p>

    <code class="box">columns=Items.*50.Name</code>

    <p>
        This will return 50 rows from the column `Items` using the index `Name`, even if there
        are only 30 legitimate columns, 50 fields will be returned. This is intentional so you can
        build models knowing at all times X number of columns will return. You can use the FFXIV CSV
        files to know exactly how many there are exactly.
    </p>

    <p>
        If you are unsure on the exact number of entries in the array or you do not mind a flexible amount
        you can ignore the number to get all entries in the array, eg:
    </p>

    <code class="box">columns=Items.*.Name</code>

    <h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>

    <p class="note">
        When copy/pasting errors to XIVAPI, remember to remove your API Key!!!!
    </p>

    <p>
        The API provides all errors and exceptions in JSON format, even if it is unrelated to the API itself.
        This is to ensure your code can always check for an error response and safely manage it. The API will
        attempt to use the correct HTTP code in all situations, otherwise it will default to a 500.
    </p>

    <p>Here is a typical response structure:</p>
<pre class="box">{
    "Error": true,
    "Subject": "XIVAPI Service Error",
    "Message": "The details of the error message",
    "Hash": "A sha1 trackable hash of the error message",
    "Ex": "The name of the exception thrown",
    "Debug": {
        // Data in here can change, it helps the XIVAPI developers understand bugs
        // Please do not code against this structure as it can change at any time.
    }
}</pre>
